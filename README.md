# ThoughtIt0.2
This is a project to develop an app which allows someone to easily notate their thoughts.
While this app is in no way intended to replace traditional note apps, it does aspire to be more convenient.
The idea is that writing notess should be as easy as sending a text message or using a messaging app. Currently, this app
contains search functions, photos, voice memos, and conveniant edit capabilities. The plan is to eventually include video,
copy paste functionality, better test coverage, exporting, perhaps a desktop client (linux/windows).
## Getting Started
Here are some of the details to get this project running on your device.
### Prerequisites
You will need to be running a copy of Android Studio and be running an sdk version of 15 or greater with 28 being the 
target sdk. I personnaly used Android Studio so I can only suggest running it that IDE.
### Install
-Clone the repo and import the project into Android Studio.
-Deploy the project onto an emulator or hardware device.
